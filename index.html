  Pingo is a free command line tool to bulk compress JPG and PNG images using lossy and lossless compression. It can compress images to more than 60% which is a very good compression level. Using lossy compression, you can compress one or multiple JPG images. And with lossless compression, you can compress one or more PNG images. It might feel strange that this tool can’t be used for lossy and lossless compression for both the image types, but this is how this tool works.

It provides five different lossless compression levels for PNG images, ranging from higher to lower compression. And for lossy compression, it provides 3 types of compression levels. You can try all the compression levels and compress your images. Higher compression level reduces image quality but still you can’t identify any changes in the image quality until you look at it very closely.

Look at the screenshot below, here you can see that images were compressed more than 60%. Do note that compression ratio could change depending on various factors such as image size, colors in images, meta description, etc. This software works great when using lossy compression as it reduces images quality as well as removes some information (like title, subject, rating, etc.).
